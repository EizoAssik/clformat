# clformat

CL-format is a Python implementation of the **format** function in Common Lisp.

## About

The function itself just depends on builtins, the **str** module and the **itertools** module.

As the format in Common Lisp used a complex rules (a powerful DSL, acctually) to format a sting, it's not that easy to reimplement a Python fork elegantly for me, so any help will be greatly appreciated.

**NOTICE**:
Only tested in CPython 3.4.1, I'm sorry but clformar cannot works in PyPy3 now. I'll fix this after the function finally works.

## Usage

```Python
from clformat import clformat
```
or
```Python
from clformat import *
```
and try it:
```Python
clformat(None, '~{~A~}!', ['Hello', ' ', 'world'])
```
