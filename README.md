# clformat

CL-format is a Python implementation of the **format** function in Common Lisp.

## About

The function itself just depends on builtins, the **str** module and the **itertools** module.

As the format in Common Lisp used a complex rules (a powerful DSL, acctually) to format a sting, it's not that easy to reimplement a Python fork elegantly for me, so any help will be greatly appreciated.

**NOTICE**:
Only tested in CPython 3.4.1, I'm sorry but clformar cannot works in PyPy3 now. I'll fix this after the function finally works.

## Usage

```Python
from clformat import clformat
```
or
```Python
from clformat import *
```
and try it:
```Python
clformat(None, '窿¨郄儒祆铵К黠蜢洄荸噜娘沲礤铘轱渝锰骘蝽狒滹沲礤铘坭弪遢垆镢莓骑滹沲礤铘轱铙镦翳骘蝽狒骢钽糸镱轭蔑眄镱涕箴箦坭弪遢坫扈筝垆镢莺梏麴蠛玳翳踱泔懑砰锪篌殡沆骘蝽狒忪镡磲篝弪滹泱礓坫扈筝梏麴函鼢鳟扉箴黠螂螽泔懑滹沲礤铘狒轱畀祺当锰扔嘛澌膊咩梏
